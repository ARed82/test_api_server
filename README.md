# test_api_server

Developer Application Test Python API  
Create a RESTful microservice to create TODO lists and entries.  
### Acceptance Criteria  
HTTP endpoint to create a new Todo list  
HTTP endpoint to fetch one existing Todo list  
HTTP endpoint to fetch a list of all existing Todo lists  
HTTP endpoint to modify an existing Todo list  
HTTP endpoint to delete an existing Todo list  
HTTP endpoint to create a new Todo item in a Todo list  
HTTP endpoint to delete a Todo item from a Todo list  
HTTP endpoint to update a Todo item in a Todo list  
JSON requests and responses  
Documentation for initializing the runtime environment, a list of shell commands is sufficient Documentation for starting the service, a list of shell commands is sufficient  
Documentation for required configuration, naming the file and configuration variables is sufficient Basic Python package structure, including requirements  
Expressive, self documenting code  
Consistent naming of variables, functions, classes, URLs  
Todo lists have a name  
Todo items have: text, due date, finished status  
Todo items never exist without a corresponding Todo list  
MongoDB as storage  
### Evaluation Criteria  
Code structure and expression.  
How readable is the code to an experienced Python developer unfamiliar with the problem?  
How pragmatic is the code, is it overengineered/too simplistic?  
Use of third-party libraries.  
Have common libraries been used in a manner sufficient to solve the issue?  
### Basic Python skills.  
Does this person have working Python skills?  
Grasp of basic concepts of RESTful, JSON, MongoDB.  
Does this person have basic knowledge of these concepts and can apply them to solve problems? Documentation  
Can this person communicate the essentials to other developers?  
### Timeframe  
This is more a guideline to indicate the scope of the expected solution. IT IS NOT PART OF THE EVALUATION CRITERIA.  
A fulltime experienced Python developer should not need more than 10 man-hours total to fulfill these criteria in their basic form.
